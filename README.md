# GitHubFeed
JavaScript to load your public GitHub feed with example HTML and CSS.

## Usage
There are a few constants you may want to edit at the top of ```src/js/feed.js``` before you deploy this feed (namely the github username you want to pull from, the number of items you want to pull, and the date format you want [ISO 8601]).

As long as you include ```feed.js``` into your site with your container object (for the feed) having class ```github```, then this will work out of the box.
